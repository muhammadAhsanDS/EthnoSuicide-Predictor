EthnoSuicide Predictor

Welcome to the EthnoSuicide Predictor! This project aims to estimate suicide rates within specific ethnic groups across various locations in the United States. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we provide valuable insights to better understand and address suicide rates among different ethnic communities.
Requirements:
To run the EthnoSuicide Predictor, you need the following:
    Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment capable of running Python code.
    Required Python packages:
        1- pandas
        2- statsmodels
        3- scikit-learn
        4- pmdarima (for time series analysis)
        5- Flask (for building the web interface)

Usage:
    1- Clone this repository to your local machine.
    2- Open the Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment.
    3- Run the code provided in the notebook to train the EthnoSuicide Predictor model.
    4- Once the model is trained, execute the Flask app by running the following command in the terminal:
    5- This will start the Flask server, and you will see a message indicating the local server address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
    6- Open your web browser and enter the provided server address.
    7- The web page will display a user-friendly interface where you can input relevant details, including demographic information and socioeconomic factors.
    8- After entering the required information, submit the form.
    9- A new page will open, displaying the predicted suicide rate based on the provided inputs.
    10- You can repeat the process with different inputs to obtain predictions for various scenarios.

Please note that the predictions provided by the EthnoSuicide Predictor are estimates based on the available data and machine learning algorithms. The model's accuracy may vary, and it is always essential to interpret the results with caution and consider other relevant factors in real-world applications.

We welcome contributions to enhance the EthnoSuicide Predictor project. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
